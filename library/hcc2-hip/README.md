# hcc2-hip
hip is a new clang language like cuda.  This repo contains the runtime , headers , build instructions, and examples for hip.   The hip language uses the cuda offload clang driver and some cuda features.   There are examples in this repo to demonstrate that the cuda language "-x cuda" also works with the cuda driver.  To use the hip language, use the "-x hip" clang or clang++ option.
